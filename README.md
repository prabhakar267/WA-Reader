# WhatsApp Reader
> WhatsApp Reader is a platform to easily read WhatsApp conversations from **email text backups** in a easy-to-read UI, because reading from the backup text file is too boring.

## How it works
 + You need a conversation file (.txt file). ([How to backup your conversations](https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/android/23756533))
 + Open [prabhakargupta.com/projects/whatsapp-reader](http://prabhakargupta.com/projects/whatsapp-reader/) and follow the instructions
 + You can even setup the project on your local. You need PHP5 and you are good to go!

```
git clone https://github.com/prabhakar267/whatsapp-reader.git
cd whatsapp-reader
```
