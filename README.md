WA Reader is a privacy-first WhatsApp chat viewer that processes backup files entirely in your browser. Built with pure JavaScript for GitHub Pages deployment, the tool supports multiple WhatsApp export formats including .txt files (US and European date formats), .json archives, and .zip files with media attachments. Users can upload their WhatsApp backup files and view conversations in a familiar chat interface with proper timestamps, usernames, emojis, and media display (images, videos, audio). All processing happens client-side ensuring complete privacy - no data is sent to any server. Simply upload your backup and view instantly.
